# What Is This Project?
This project is a weather forecast application built using Streamlit and Plotly Express in Python. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input (place and forecast days) and displays the temperature and sky conditions for the selected location.

## This is my seventh app taught by [Ardit Sulce](https://github.com/arditsulceteaching)
